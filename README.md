AutoRouting
===========

AutoRouting module for ASP.NET MVC 4 applications


Are you tired of manually entering .MapRoute() for each non-default controller action? AutoRouting is a solution.



Remarks
-------
AutoRouting is not currently working with Areas. If you need it to work with it feel free to "git clone" and contribute.
